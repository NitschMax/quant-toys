## Black–Scholes intuition: distribution and call price

This project explores basic intuition behind the Black–Scholes model.

### What is implemented
- Visualization of the lognormal distribution of the terminal asset price \( S_T \)
- Analytical Black–Scholes price of a European call option
- Call price plotted as a function of the strike price

### Goal
The purpose of this script is to build intuition for how the assumptions of the Black–Scholes model translate into
- the shape of the terminal price distribution, and
- the dependence of option prices on the strike.

The focus is on visualization and understanding, not on performance or calibration.

### Notes
This is a simple, self-contained toy model intended for exploratory and educational use.
