## Standard Brownian motion: sample paths and variability

This project explores basic properties of standard Brownian motion through simulation.

### What is implemented
- Simulation of standard Brownian motion paths over a fixed time interval
- Visualization of multiple sample paths (e.g. 1000 runs) to illustrate pathwise variability
- Basic inspection of scaling behavior and qualitative properties of the process

### Goal
The goal of this script is to build intuition for Brownian motion as a stochastic process by visualizing how individual sample paths behave and how variability emerges across realizations.
