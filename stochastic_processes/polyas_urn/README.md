## Polya’s urn: reinforcement and a limiting random variable

This project explores Pólya’s urn as a simple reinforcement process.
See Stochastic Calculus: An Introduction with Applications by G. F. Lawler for more details.

### What is implemented
- Simulation of the proportion of red balls in the urn over time
- Plot of the convergence of the associated martingale in a single run
- Histogram over many runs showing the empirical distribution of the limit

### Goal
Build intuition for reinforcement processes and martingale convergence, and illustrate that the limiting proportion is random.

### Notes
This is an exploratory toy model intended for intuition-building and visualization.
