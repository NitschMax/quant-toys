# quant-toys

A collection of small quantitative finance and stochastic modeling toy projects.

The purpose of this repository is to build intuition for quantitative models through simple simulations and visualizations.  
These projects are exploratory and educational in nature, not production-ready trading systems.

Each subfolder contains a short description of the idea being explored and references where applicable.
